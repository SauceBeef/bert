A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was involved in a collision while making a right hand turn from northbound Valencia Street onto 16th Street. The Cruise AV was stopped at a green light in between crosswalks of Valencia Street and 16th Street, waiting for pedestrians to cross over 16th Street. A different pedestrian from the southwest corner of Valencia and 16th ran across Valencia Street, against the "do not walk" symbol, shouting, and struck the left side of the Cruise AV's rear bumper and hatch with his entire body. There were no injuries but the Cruise AV sustained some damage to its left rear light. The police were not called.
